# Cortex - System Documentation

**Document version:** 1.11 (2026-03-19) - Aligned to current constitutional and runtime repo state
**Protocol:** Forge Documentation Protocol v1

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Project** | Cortex |
| **Prefix** | `cx` |
| **Output** | `doc/cxSYSTEM.md` |

This `doc/system/` tree is the assembled system reference for Cortex as a bounded local file-intelligence service.
It reflects the current repo state through Wave 3 hardening, audit-remediation tightening, the shared source-lane framework, Runtime Slices 1 through 9, the post-Slice-7 hardening and lane-admission-governance pass, bounded ODT lane delivery, bounded EPUB lane delivery, the post-Slice-8 governance execution, the post-Slice-9 governance selection, and the bounded special-track Scrivener Stage 1 authority-recon runtime slice.

Assembly contract:

- Command: `bash doc/system/BUILD.sh`
- Output: `doc/cxSYSTEM.md`
